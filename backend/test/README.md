## How to use

1. Install Postman.
2. Import this collection of data.
3. It contains three test cases testing the endpoints:

   - http://localhost:8000/image/upload
   - http://localhost:8000/users/profile
   - http://localhost:8000/users/update-profile

4. Although it is testing backend endpoints, you need to start front end, login in with a valid user and get its bearer token, and paste the token into the Token field of Authentication tab for each test case.
